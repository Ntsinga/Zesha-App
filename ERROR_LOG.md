# Error Log

Use this file to track frontend and app issues, root causes, fixes, and validation.
Add new entries at the top so the most recent incidents stay visible.
Before starting work on a bug or incident, review the lessons in relevant past entries.

## Incident Writing Standard

Use short, concrete bullets.
Write what happened, why it happened, what changed, how it was verified, and what the team should remember next time.

### Example

- Status: Resolved
- Area: UI / State
- Symptoms: A controlled amount input removed a trailing decimal while the user was still typing.
- Root cause: The component converted the in-progress string value to a number on every change, so `1000.` was normalized to `1000` during re-render.
- Solution implemented: Store the draft input as a string while editing, convert only when committing, and preserve intermediate values like `""` and `"."`.
- Validation: Verified typing flows on mobile and web, confirmed the displayed value preserves intermediate input states, and ran the relevant frontend error checks.
- Lessons learned: Controlled numeric inputs need explicit support for intermediate string states. Do not coerce user input to a number on every keystroke.
- Notes: If this recurs, inspect the component state shape before changing formatter utilities.
